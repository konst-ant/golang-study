- Misc
    - `label1:` - declare label, which can be used as reference, e.g. break label1
    - `import math.rand.v2` - for random generator
    - `time` - package to use time
    - `os` - package for work with OS (create files, etc.)
    - `json` - package for marshall/unmmarshall JSON
    - `VAR=3 go run .` - set variable and run application
      NOTE: for Linux equivalent is `set VAR=3 && gor run .`
    - `var := os.Getenv(VAR)` - read environment variable
    - `os.Environ()` - get environment variables as key=value
    - `strings.SplitN(keyValueString, "=", 2)` - split string of key=value using '=' into 2 parts
    - `aes` - library for encryption

- Meta-Tags
  ```type Account struct {login string `json:"login" xml:"test"`} ```  - this is meta-teg, kind of annotation which can be used e.g. for
  serialization/des of objects from JSON etc. Standard package reflect
  uses meta-tags.
      
  NOTE: to be able marshall/unmarshall fields of the struct need being public that is "Login" instead of "login"

- Environtment variables
  - `VAR=3 go run .` - set variable and run application
    NOTE: for Linux equivalent is `set VAR=3 && gor run .`
  - `var := os.Getenv(VAR)` - read environment variable
  - `os.Environ()` - get environment variables as key=value
  - `strings.SplitN(keyValueString, "=", 2)` - split string of key=value using '=' into 2 parts
  - also we can use `.env` or `.env.local` or `.env.develop` or `.env.prod`, etc. file to put environment variables of application
  - to ready .env we can use package `go get github.com/joho/godotenv`
    - `err := godotenv.Load()` - load from .env into memory together with existing environment variables. Can return error if it couldn't find .env file


- Questions
    - Will `append(myDynamicSlice, 100)` allocate new memory and copy array to new memory? If yes, isn't is suboptimal?
    - How can I do join / subtract / ... of arrays / slices in Go?
    - Assume we have a dynamic slice `myDynamicSlice := []int{1, 2, 3}`, how can we remove the 0-th element from it? And would the address of the slide be changed (requiring change of variables)?
